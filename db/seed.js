  {title: "Upset!", content: "I’m so upset!! I don’t even know where to begin! To start off, I think I completely failed my geometry quiz, which I know I should’ve studied more for...my dad’s not gonna be happy about that. :( Then, we had a pop quiz in history on the reading homework from last night, and I completely forgot most of what I read, which made me even more upset because I actually did the reading! But what really made me mad was the note that Sarah slipped into my locker during passing period. She said she was sad that I’ve been hanging out with Jane more lately and thinks that I don’t want to be her friend anymore. I can’t believe she thinks that, especially after talking with her on the phone for hours and hours last month while she was going through her breakup with Nick! Just because I’ve been hanging out with Jane a little more than usual doesn’t mean I’m not her friend anymore. She completely blew me off at lunch, and when I told Jane, she thought that Sarah was being a drama queen. This is just what I need! My parents are getting on my case about doing more extracurricular activities, I have a huge paper due for AP English soon, and I can’t understand a thing in advanced Spanish! The last thing I need is for my best friend to think I hate her and barely text me back anymore. Uggh! I can’t concentrate on anything right now because of it. I hope she gets over it!!!.", user_id:2},
	{title: "Depressed!", content: "I feel sick, I really do. I feel sick of myself, sick of Chris, sick of everyone, sick of this house, my work, my laptop, my bedroom, sick of arguments, sick of feeling sick and sick of the problems inside my head. I am also sick of the way I feel incapable of doing anything about any of it. I want to help myself, but I destroy everything instead. It’s like someone else is doing these things; it’s not me, but it is me. The bitch does it. She loves pressing all the wrong buttons of destruction. The real me is much nicer than her! I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up – or go into hibernation for as long as it takes for my brain to calm down and to feel brighter and more optimistic when I wake up, as I always do at some point. This is not going to happen. I decided to write it down – maybe it will help.Then I make the mistake of having more contact with Chris and he wants one final chance to talk about it all. This makes me really angry – I have nothing left to say. I am fucked, I am lying on my bed with my laptop and my mobile, either texting frantically or shouting and screaming and abusing Chris down the phone. I don’t have it in me to think straight, I am running on autopilot, so how the fuck could I talk about things with him? I have talked about things so many times, with hope, only to be let down, to be lied to. I have no trust left in this man, I hate him, I hate his lies, I hate everything about him and just about everything else in my life too. How can I know all this and do it anyway? Why am I so out of control?My Dad goes out to do the food shopping and I keep a happy tone in my voice while I talk about the weather and the time of day for going shopping.‘Will it be quieter at this time?’ I ask him.What do I care? I don’t. I do a little bit, but not much. It’s just making conversation to keep up my normal persona – ‘the performing monkey’ I like to call it now. I am sure he has heard me on the phone this morning, shouting at and abusing Chris, but he doesn’t say anything – he is probably trying to ignore it now, as it happens so often. He knows I am out of control and has tried to curb my outbursts before and he told me once to ‘pack it in!’ but I cannot help it. I get so angry – and get drunk more than he knows, in secret. Once he has gone, I start crying, really hard, on my bed. I feel desperate.Chris keeps phoning, wanting me to come out for lunch now, saying that the anger gets me nowhere. I scream at him! I wish I had finished it a long time ago but I was too weak, and now I just hate him. I like him a little bit, but inside, I hate what he has done and I cannot forgive or forget it all. It seems petty to me sometimes, but it is the way I feel and the way I am. Liking him a bit is my worst nightmare as that is why I keep going back for more. Am I just lonely, do I just want the escape, do I love him, am I using him or am I just so fucked up I am not making the decisions? I think the latter is the right answer – I think that I don’t think, therefore I just do these things and continue my life in a daze.He tries to placate me. I am fuming, I scream at him, I hit the wall beside me and hurt my hand, I throw the phone, I run to the bathroom, and then I see my face and neck in the mirror. My face is distorted – evil looking, not like I do in my many happy/smiley photos – like a monster; an alien. I don’t like that person looking back at me, that person who is out of control and whose neck looks like the protruding, twisted roots of an old oak tree. I stop still. I stop the face. I stop the neck. Then I screw up my face and neck again, just to show myself, once more, what a monster I can portray. Oh my god. I am disgusted with myself now, and I calm down, and go back to my laptop on my single bed in my tiny room, to continue writing all of this down.", user_id:2},
