                                <p>Studies have shown that writing or speaking whatâ€™s on our minds is extremely beneficial to our sense of self and well-being. Unfortunately many people don't take the time to write out what's on their minds and others are often embarrassed or unwilling to express themselves in front of another person. <i>This is the problem we are trying to solve.</i></p>
                                <p>Solace is a platform that provides users with an easy and accurate method of self-introspection. Each day, users are encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings with Solace by simply speaking to the app. Solace will then analyze the recordings and output a visual representation of the user's personality and emotional insights, allowing users to learn and discover more about themselves.</p>
